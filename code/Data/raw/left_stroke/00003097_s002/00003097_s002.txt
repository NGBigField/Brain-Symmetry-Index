CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old male with bilateral carotid artery disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and MI.  This is a right carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Etomidate, Isoflurane, Succinylcholine, Vecuronium, Heparin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the OR using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The EEG begins with the patient in the OR at 9:01 and concludes at __:__.  It is recorded in two samples.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient has already received sedative hypnotic medications.  The background includes a mixture rich in beta and alpha frequency activity.  As the flurane dose is increased at 9:08:40, the record becomes slightly discontinuous.  The initial anesthetic recording is a dynamic pattern with variability in terms of the degree of discontinuity. The discontinuous pattern is noted from 9:00 to 10:00 AM, but is improving by 9:45.
Heparin is given at 10:30 AM, and the EEG is continuous at that point, rich in alpha and beta frequency activity.  The clamp is placed at 10:36.  No changes are identified with the placement of the clamp.  The recording continues until the clamp is removed at 11:51.  No focal features are seen.

HR:  94 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this carotid endarterectomy did not identify focal features.
